                <h4><b>1. The easiest, fastest yet least popular way is this -></b></h4>
                <p>Get a Diploma in engineering from a polytechnic college and then complete your B.Tech
                 in CS/IT. You will get lateral 2ndyr entry into BTech degree courses after a Diploma.</p>
                <p> You don’t need maths in Class 12 for this.</p>
                <h4><b>2. Otherwise, go for BCA- MCA -></b></h4><p> You can later also pursue an M.Tech or can 
                even apply for an MS in an international university. You don’t need maths in Class 12 for this.</p>
                <h4><b>3. Otherwise, go for a Bachelor’s in Mathematics or Statistics</b></h4> <p>(BA/BSc/BMath/BStat). </p>
                <p> You need maths in Class 12 for this.</p>
                <p>4.Then, you can do MCA and enter into the IT industry. OR, you can simply go for self-help courses in coding
